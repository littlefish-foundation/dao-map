They give their users the opportunity to be exposed to the price of real-world assets on the blockchain environment. These on-chain real-world assets are also known as synthetic assets.\nIndigo is an over-collateralized protocol, which means that the user must provide more capital than they are borrowing in order to take a loan. Synthetic Assets on Indigo Protocol are also known as **iAssets**. There are two ways you can obtain an iAsset in Indigo: by buying or by minting. Users can buy iAssets if the exchange has any available supply, if not than the second way need to be applied. When minting an asset is important to notice that the user needs to deposit collateral and create a loan.",
